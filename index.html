<h1>Big Data Analysis</h1>
  <p>Khan Academy Modules:</p>
  <p>Module 1: Data Tools</p>
  <p>This module was very interesting.  I have had little to no experience with large data sets, and certainly no experience with SQL.  
    I am actually enrolled in a database class next semester and the small glimpse at SQL in this module got me excited for that class.  
    The ability to manipulate data in order to tell a story is obviously of great importance in the digital age in which we live, so tools like 
    SQL and even spreadsheet software for that use is very interesting to me.</p>
  <p>Module 2: Big Data</p>
  <p>This module gave some good insight into how big data is stored and processed.  For the average user of online systems, how our data is stored is not front of mind,
    For most, "the website" is where their data is stored.  Little mind is given to the fact that there are massive data warehouses that are dedicated to the sole purpose of 
    storing data from these services.  And if how our data is stored is out of mind for most, certainly so is how the data is processed for analytical purposes.  
    Meaning, most average users assume that sorting, searching, and categorizing hashtags on social media is a basic, easily accomplished, feature.  
    What the general population likely do not understand is that in order to process such massive quantities of data, massive amounts of computing power is needed as well.  
    And in order to actually utilize that computing power, a computer scientist is behind the algorithms and code to make that possible.</p>
  <p>Module 3: Bias in machine learning</p>

<p>Question to be answered: What is the correlation between the cost of Catfish and time?</p>
